# Fake News Detection in Dravidian Languages

The proliferation of online social media over the past few years has significantly streamlined the ways in which individuals are able to communicate with one another. Users of social media platforms are able to exchange information, communicate and maintain awareness of current events. On the other hand, much of the recent information that has been emerging on social media is false and, in some instances, is intended to mislead users. This type of content is commonly referred to as fake news. Any false or misleading information that appears as original news is considered as fake news. 

There are two subtasks:

Task 1: The goal of this task is to classify a given social media text into original or fake. The sources of data are various social-media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook etc. Given a social media post, the objective of the shared task is to classify it into either fake or original news. For example, the following two posts belong to fake and original categories, respectively. 

Task 2: The Fake News Detection from Malayalam News (FakeDetect-Malayalam) shared task provides a platform for researchers to address the pressing challenge of identifying and flagging fake news within the realm of Malayalam-language news articles. In an age of information overload, accurate detection of misinformation is crucial for fostering trustworthy communication. The core objective of the FakeDetect-Malayalam shared task is to encourage participants to develop effective models capable of accurately detecting and classifying fake news articles in the Malayalam language into different categories. Here, we considered five fake categories - False, Half True, Mostly False, Partly False and Mostly True
